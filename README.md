CSV Major Mode
=======================

This is my attempt to update the foundation originally created by
[Francis J Wright](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FrancisJWright).
And published on the [EmacsWiki][csv-mode-wiki].  It needs to be
corrected/updated.  If I succeed, I will figure out how to get these
changes pushed back upstream for all to use.

## WARNING

This is not ready for prime-time use yet.  I am going to attempt to
see this through but life does get in the way, so please do not expect
this to be an overly active or sustained effort.  If there is a
similar effort farther along, let me know and I will
coordinate/consolidate our efforts.

## TODO

* Fix load errors
* Build new recipe to load better
* Finally figure out unit testing in emacs
* Push changes back upstream
* improve el-get recipe
